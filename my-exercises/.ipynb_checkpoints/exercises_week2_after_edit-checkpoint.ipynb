    "Today's exercises will be related to chapters 3, 4, 5 from DSfS. The point of these exercises is to refresh your memory on some mathematics and get you comfortable doing computations in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises today cover:\n",
    "* Basic visualization\n",
    "* Linear algebra\n",
    "* Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**: Some of you may be new to solving problems using code. You may be wondering *what level of detail* I expect in your solutions, your code comments and explanations. **This is the guideline:** Solve the exercises in a manner that allows you to—later in life—use them as examples. This also means that you should add code comments when the code isn't self-explanatory or if you're afraid it won't make sense when you look at it with fresh eyes. You may also want to comment on your output in plain text to capture the conclusions you arrive at throughout your analysis. But express yourself succinctly. To quote (probably) Einstein: *\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler\"*. Finally, when you optimize for your own future comprehension, other people will be able to understand what you did.\n",

The eigenvector with the greatest *eigenvalue* points along the direction of greatest variation, and so on. This is pretty neat, because if we know along which axes the data is most stretched, we can figure out how best to project it when visualizing it in 2D as a scatter plot! This whole procedure has a name: **Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) and it was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901. It belongs to a powerful class of linear algebra methods called **Matrix Factorization** methods. Ok, so rather than spending too much time on the math of PCA, let's just use the `sklearn` implementation and fit a PCA on `X`."
